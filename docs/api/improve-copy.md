## Best Practices

### 1. Provide Context

Helps tailor tone and style appropriately:

```json
{
  "context": "Error message in healthcare app (HIPAA compliant environment)",
  "target_audience": "Medical professionals"
}
```

### 2. Specify Audience

Different audiences need different approaches:

- **Developers**: Technical, precise, actionable
- **End users**: Simple, friendly, reassuring
- **Executives**: Business-focused, outcome-oriented

### 3. Include Original Intent

If the text has specific requirements:

```json
{
  "context": "Must maintain professional tone, max 100 characters"
}
```
