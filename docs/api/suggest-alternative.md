## Example: State Management

<details>
<summary>View full example with alternatives</summary>

**Input:**

```json
{
  "currentApproach": "Using Redux for state management in React app",
  "goals": ["Global state management", "Simple developer experience"],
  "constraints": ["Small team", "Simple CRUD app", "20 components"]
}
```

**Response Summary:**

```markdown
## Alternative 1: React Context + useReducer

**Description**: Built-in React solution for global state

**Pros:**

- No external dependencies
- Simpler setup
- Smaller bundle size
- Familiar to React developers

**Cons:**

- Less DevTools support
- Manual optimization needed
- No middleware ecosystem

**Best for**: Small to medium apps, simple state logic

## Alternative 2: Zustand

**Description**: Minimal state management with hooks

**Pros:**

- Much smaller than Redux (1KB vs 45KB)
- Simpler API
- No boilerplate
- Good TypeScript support

**Cons:**

- Smaller ecosystem
- Less mature
- Fewer learning resources

**Best for**: Apps needing global state without Redux complexity

## Alternative 3: Jotai

**Description**: Atomic state management

**Pros:**

- Atomic approach prevents unnecessary re-renders
- Minimal boilerplate
- Good TypeScript support
- Built-in async support

**Cons:**

- Different mental model
- Smaller community
- Learning curve

**Best for**: Performance-critical apps

## Recommendation

For a small CRUD app with 20 components, **Zustand** or **Context + useReducer**
are likely better fits than Redux. Redux adds unnecessary complexity for your scale.

Start with Context + useReducer (zero dependencies), move to Zustand if you
need better performance or more features.

## Example: API Communication

<details>
<summary>View full example with alternatives</summary>

**Input:**

```json
{
  "currentApproach": "Using WebSockets for real-time notifications in mobile app",
  "constraints": ["Battery life is a concern", "Connection is intermittent"]
}
```

**Response Summary:**

```markdown
## Alternative 1: Server-Sent Events (SSE)

**Description**: One-way real-time updates from server

**Pros:**

- Better battery life than WebSockets
- Automatic reconnection
- Works over HTTP (simpler infrastructure)
- Simpler than WebSockets

**Cons:**

- One-way only (server ‚Üí client)
- Limited browser support on older devices
- No binary data support

**Best for**: Notification/update streams where client rarely sends data

## Alternative 2: Push Notifications + Polling

**Description**: OS push notifications with occasional API polling

**Pros:**

- Excellent battery life
- Works with device in background
- Native OS integration
- Reliable delivery

**Cons:**

- Push notification setup complexity
- Polling delay for immediate updates
- Requires FCM/APNS setup

**Best for**: Mobile apps where instant updates aren't critical

## Alternative 3: HTTP Long Polling

**Description**: Client holds request open until server has data

**Pros:**

- Works everywhere (HTTP)
- Better battery than constant polling
- Simple fallback mechanism
- No special infrastructure

**Cons:**

- Higher latency than WebSockets
- More server resources
- Connection management complexity

**Best for**: Apps needing real-time updates with maximum compatibility

## Recommendation

For mobile with intermittent connectivity and battery concerns, \*\*Push Notifications

- periodic polling\*\* is likely the best approach. Use push for important updates,
  poll every 30-60 seconds when app is active.

WebSockets are overkill and drain battery. SSE is better but still drains
battery more than push notifications.

## Best Practices

<details>
<summary><strong>How to Get Better Alternatives</strong></summary>

### Describe Your Current Approach Clearly

**Good:**

```json
{
  "current_approach": "Using Elasticsearch for product search, costs $500/mo for 100k products, query time ~100ms"
}
```

**Bad:**

```json
{
  "current_approach": "Using Elasticsearch"
}
```

### 2. Include Constraints in Context

```json
{
  "context": "Budget: $100/mo, Team: 2 developers, No DevOps experience"
}
```

### 3. Mention What You've Already Considered

```json
{
  "constraints": ["Considered PostgreSQL full-text search but concerned about performance"]
}
```
